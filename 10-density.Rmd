# Density {#density}

Precise and unbiased population density estimates are fundamental to
conserve rare and vulnerable species... But it can be complicated to
calculate, especially with camera traps!

There we said it, estimating density from camera trap data is not easy,
often isn't precise, and can require you to move beyond "just" R
(typically JAGS or Nimble). Also - over the last few years the number of
density estimation approaches has grown rapidly, consequently it is
impossible to cover all of them here.

There have been several great review papers published recently, and we
recommend you check each one out:

[Morin, Dana J., et al. "Comparison of methods for estimating density
and population trends for low-density Asian bears." Global Ecology and
Conservation 35 (2022):
e02058.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989422000609)
This paper is great for overview of the different methods available with
a specific species in mind - Asian black bear. They discuss the methods,
and do not directly compare them.

This paper provides a nice overview of the state of the art of density
estimation of unmarked animals. They discuss the methods, and do not

## Individually identifiable individuals

If you are dealing with a project with individually identifiable
animals, you are in luck as there are some great resources created by
Ian Durbach and David Borchers: <https://www.scr-cameratrap.com/> and
[an amazing tool for helping you design your
surveys](https://www.otago.ac.nz/density/secrdesign.html) called
`secrdesign`. Spatial capture recapture is considered the gold standard
in density estimation, you cannot get much better than this!

## Unmarked animals

Unfortunately, it is not possible to identify individuals for the vast
majority of species detected by camera traps. There are a growing number
of analysis frameworks for unmarked animals, including:

### Random encounter model

The random encounter model is based on modelling the 'random encounters'
between moving animals and stationary camera traps. It takes into
account key variables that affect the encounter rate:

-   the camera detection zone, defined by its radius (length) and angle,
-   the daily distance traveled by an animal in the population (a.k.a.
    day range)

Parameters required [*and how you might get them*]:

**y** = number of independent photo events [*from our independent
detections file*]

**t** = total survey effort [*from our deployment data*]

**v** = average speed of animal movement [*We could use telemetry or we
could use speed estimates derived from camera traps*]

**r** = radius (length) of camera detection zone [*We could use field
trials as these parameters can vary station to station or the
manufacturer specifications*]

**theta** = angle of camera detection zone [*We could use field trials as
these parameters could vary station to station, or the manufacturer
specifications*]

In this case we have speed data for moose and wolf in both winter and
summer (derived from telemetry studies which occurred close to our
region of interest). So let's compare density estimates between winter
(Oct-Mar) and summer (Apr-Sep) between these two species.

In our project we didn't empirically measure the detection zone, so we
will assume that these remain constant through time time and space.

First, install the remBoot package to help us fit the REM model.

```{r ch12_2, class.source="Rmain", message=F, warning=F}
#devtools::install_github("arcaravaggi/remBoot")
library(remBoot); library(dplyr); library(lubridate)
```

#### Formatting

The formulation of the REM included in the 'remBoot' package is fairly
simple, a dataframe consisting of rows, where each row is an independent
detection, and with columns reflecting the strata of interest
(confusingly labeled `site`), `location_id` (labelled `cam`), the
`group_size` (labelled `count`), the viewshed length/radius (in km) and
the viewshed angle (width) in radians.

Note: in this instance, we don't have empirically derived measures of
the viewshed length and angle, so we will use a estimated average
viewshed length based on the habitats we deployed cameras, and the
reported viewshed angle assessed by TrailCameraPro by Reconyx for the
Hyperfire 2 (the camera model used in this study):
[angle](https://www.trailcampro.com/pages/trail-camera-detection-field-of-view-angle)
= 42.9; and distance = 14m.

For a discussion of why good estimates of viewshed properties are
important see: [Carswell, Brendan M., Tal Avgar, Garrett M. Street, Sean
P. Boyle, and Eric Vander Wal. "Dead zones, obstructions, and missed
captures: A novel approach for determining the Effective Capture Area
for remote camera traps." bioRxiv (2024):
2024-05.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.09.593241v1.full.pdf)

Moose first!

### Moose

From existing literature, we are expecting moose densities of roughly
0.2-0.5 individuals per km2.

```{r ch12_3, class.source="Rmain"}
ind <- read.csv("data/processed_data/AlgarRestorationProject_30min_independent_detections.csv", header=T)

# Setup a winter and summer months variable
summer <- c("04", "05", "06", "07", "08", "09")
winter <- c("01", "02", "03", "10", "11", "12")


# Subset to moose (alces alces) and the summer months
moose_summer <- ind[ind$sp=="Alces.alces" & substr(ind$timestamp,6,7) %in% summer,c("placename", "event_groupsize")]
# rename the columns
moose_summer <- moose_summer %>% 
                   rename("cam"=placename,
                   "count"=event_groupsize)

moose_summer$dist <- 0.014             # Our detection distance in km
moose_summer$theta <- 42.9*(pi/180)    # Our viewshed angle

# Subset to moose (alces alces) and the winter months
moose_winter <- ind[ind$sp=="Alces.alces" & substr(ind$timestamp,6,7) %in% winter,c("placename", "event_groupsize")] 

# rename the columns
moose_winter <- moose_winter %>% 
                 rename("cam"=placename,
                 "count"=event_groupsize)

# Add the detection zone covariates
moose_winter$dist <- 0.014
moose_winter$theta <- 42.9*(pi/180)

```

Finally we need two constants:

1)  the effort in each given strata of interest (hours), and 2) the
    average day range of the focal animal.

To get the number of hours per season, we can use the
monthly_observations dataframe:

```{r ch12_4, class.source="Rmain"}
mon_obs <- read.csv("data/processed_data/AlgarRestorationProject_30min_independent_monthly_observations.csv", header=T)

#times number of days by 24
summer_effort <- sum(mon_obs$days[substr(mon_obs$date, 6,7) %in% summer])*24
winter_effort <- sum(mon_obs$days[substr(mon_obs$date, 6,7) %in% winter])*24

```

Here I will use the average daily distance for summer and winter derived
from telemetry datasets on Movebank from locations close to where this
camera trap study was conducted:

Moose winter = 1.07 km per day Moose summer = 1.15 km per day

Now lets fit the REM model.

```{r ch12_5, class.source="Rmain"}
nboots <- 1000

summer_rem <- rem(dat = moose_summer, tm=summer_effort, v=1.15)
winter_rem <- rem(dat = moose_winter, tm=winter_effort, v=1.07) 

moose_res <- data.frame(season=c("summer", "winter"), 
             species="moose", 
             density=c(summer_rem,winter_rem), 
             sd=NA)

# Add the sd
tm <- summer_effort
v <- 1.15
moose_res$sd[moose_res$season=="summer"] <- sd(boot_sd(moose_summer))

tm <- winter_effort
v <- 1.07
moose_res$sd[moose_res$season=="winter"] <- sd(boot_sd(moose_winter))



```

Take a look at your results:

```{r ,class.source="Rmain"}
moose_res
```

Remember, we were expecting a density of around 0.2 to 0.5 individuals
per km^2^... So we are perhaps on the low side.

Lets make a plot of the estimated densities and their standard
deviations:

```{r ,class.source="Rmain"}
library(ggplot2)
p<-ggplot(moose_res, aes(x=season, y=density)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=density-sd, ymax=density+sd), width=.2,
                position=position_dodge(0.05)) +
  theme_classic()
  
p
```

### Wolf

From existing literature we would expect wolf densities of 0.001 - 0.025
individuals per km^2^.

Lets repeat our analysis for wolves:

```{r, class.source="Rmain"}
# Subset to moose (alces alces) and the summer months
wolf_summer <- ind[ind$sp=="Canis.lupus" & substr(ind$timestamp,6,7) %in% summer,c("placename", "event_groupsize")]
# rename the columns
wolf_summer <- wolf_summer %>% 
  rename("cam"=placename,
         "count"=event_groupsize)

wolf_summer$dist <- 0.014             # Our detection distance in km
wolf_summer$theta <- 42.9*(pi/180)    # Our viewshed angle

# Subset to wolf (alces alces) and the winter months
wolf_winter <- ind[ind$sp=="Canis.lupus" & substr(ind$timestamp,6,7) %in% winter,c("placename", "event_groupsize")] 

# rename the columns
wolf_winter <- wolf_winter %>% 
  rename("cam"=placename,
         "count"=event_groupsize)

# Add the detection zone covariates
wolf_winter$dist <- 0.014
wolf_winter$theta <- 42.9*(pi/180)

```

We have the following values for wolf movement

Wolf winter = 11.8 km per day Wolf summer = 11.9 km per day

```{r, class.source="Rmain"}
summer_rem <- rem(dat = wolf_summer, tm=summer_effort, v=11.9)
winter_rem <- rem(dat = wolf_winter, tm=winter_effort, v=11.8) 

wolf_res <- data.frame(season=c("summer", "winter"), 
             species="wolf", 
             density=c(summer_rem,winter_rem), 
             sd=NA)

# Add the sd
tm <- summer_effort
v <- 11.9
wolf_res$sd[wolf_res$season=="summer"] <- sd(boot_sd(wolf_summer))

tm <- winter_effort
v <- 11.8
wolf_res$sd[wolf_res$season=="winter"] <- sd(boot_sd(wolf_winter))


```

Which again, is fairly close to the low end of our expected densities, however wolf control has been conducted in the area.

```{r ,class.source="Rmain"}
library(ggplot2)
p<-ggplot(wolf_res, aes(x=season, y=density)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=density-sd, ymax=density+sd), width=.2,
                position=position_dodge(0.05)) +
  theme_classic()
  
p
```

These estimates are in the right ball park, and suggest that wolf
densities are higher in winter in this region.

[Palencia, Pablo, et al. "Random encounter model is a reliable method
for estimating population density of multiple species using camera
traps." Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation
(2022).](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361547983_Random_encounter_model_is_a_reliable_method_for_estimating_population_density_of_multiple_species_using_camera_traps)

[Palencia, Pablo, et al. "Assessing the camera trap methodologies used
to estimate density of unmarked populations." Journal of Applied Ecology
58.8 (2021):
1583-1592.](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13913)

### Time to event / Space to event density estimates

Whist the REM has been around for a while, there are a couple of new
density formulations on the block! Time to event (TTE) and Space to
event (STE).

Both TTE and STE models use the mathematical relationship between the
poisson and exponential distributions to estimate animal density.
Conceptually, TTE and STE rely on the basic idea that greater abundance
in an area leads to greater detection rates at cameras. The first of
these, TTE, estimates abundance from the amount of time that elapses
before an animal enters the viewshed of a given camera.

-   TTE requires an independent estimate of animal movement rate. TTE is
    the only method of the three that requires an estimate of mean
    animal movement rate, defined across all animal behaviors, including
    rest (Moeller et al. 2018)

-   Conceptually, STE is similar to TTE with space substituted for
    time... In contrast to TTE, the STE model uses instantaneous
    sampling occasions, and therefore it does not depend on movement
    rate.

For both methods, cameras should be randomly or systematically deployed
across the sampling frame. Practices to increase detections, such as
targeting high-use trails, should be avoided as they can bias the
abundance estimates. Second, the authors note that animals should have no
behavioral response to cameras or camera sites. This precludes the use
of bait or lures to increase encounter rates. It also means that cameras
should be unobtrusive and not repel animals with bright flashes or human
scent. Finally, the area viewed by each camera should be known across
time and measured accurately. If camera area is not measured accurately,
abundance estimates will be biased.

For STE, motion-sensor detection probability is defined by four
conditions: the animal is present in the camera's viewshed, the motion
sensor detects the animal, the camera takes a picture with the animal
still in view, and the user correctly identifies the species.

Sampling effort is difficult to quantify from motion-sensor photography,
as the outcome (no picture) is the same whether the camera stops
working, the motion-sensor doesn't detect the animal, or the animal is
absent. Time-lapse photography can help define motion-sensor effort if
the two are used in conjunction. For example, time-lapse photos
throughout the day will show that the batteries are functioning, the
lens is clear of snow and debris, and the camera is pointed in the
intended direction, which can help give confidence that the motion
sensor is working as intended.

STE and TTE use camera data in a particularly unique way that may be
unfamiliar to many users. Rather than using counts of individual animals
or independent detection events, STE uses the amount of space sampled by
cameras until an animal detection at a given time, while TTE uses the
time elapsed from an arbitrary starting point to the first detection of
the species of interest.

*Note* The details above represent an abridged form of the information
in:

[Moeller, Anna K., and Paul M. Lukacs. "spaceNtime: an R package for
estimating abundance of unmarked animals using camera-trap photographs."
Mammalian Biology (2021):
1-10.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42991-021-00181-8)

Lets attempt to apply the STE method to moose.

We base our settings based on those in:

An application of this method on wolves can be seen here:

[Ausband, David E., et al. "Estimating wolf abundance from cameras."
Ecosphere 13.2 (2022): e3933. Ausband, D. E.,
Luk](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.3933)

They didn't also estimate viewshed size: **"we did not estimate
viewshed area during camera deployment; thus, we used a viewshed area
based on expected performance of motion-triggered cameras. We assumed
the cameras detected wolves within a 106-m2, pie-slice shape area in
front of the camera derived from standard field protocols and that the
motion trigger detected all wolves that passed through the viewshed."**

#### Moose

```{r ch12_9, class.source="Rmain"}
#library(remotes)
#remotes::install_github("annam21/spaceNtime", build_vignettes=TRUE)
library(spaceNtime)
```

The first thing we need is a dataframe of all the detections of our
focal species with three columns:

-   cam: the `placename` (camera location) where surveys occured
-   datetime: the 'timestamp'
-   count: the group count

```{r ch12_10, eval=F, class.source="Rmain"}
img <- read.csv("data/processed_data/AlgarRestorationProject_raw_detections.csv", header=T)

# Make ind timestamp a date object
img$timestamp <- ymd_hms(img$timestamp)

moose_dat <- img %>% 
  filter(sp=="Alces.alces") %>% 
  dplyr::select(placename, timestamp, event_groupsize) %>% 
  rename(cam = placename,
         datetime = timestamp,
         count = event_groupsize)


```

`spaceNtime` also needs camera deployment data. Luckily, the deployment
data it requires is identical to how we store deployment data - each row
represents a block of continuous activity, and if the camera ever goes
off then comes back online, that is represented as a new row.

The deployment data needs the following columns:

-   cam: the `placename` (camera location) where surveys occured
-   start: deployment start date\
-   end: deployment end date\
-   area: area in sq meters (we will use the same definition as in the
    REM example 14m depth and radius of 42.9 -\> 68.4m^2^)

```{r, class.source="Rmain", eval=F}
dep <-  read.csv("data/raw_data/example_data/deployments.csv", header=T)

dep$start_date <- ymd_hms(paste(dep$start_date, "12:00:00"))
dep$end_date   <- ymd_hms(paste(dep$end_date, "11:59:00"))

snt_dep <- dep %>% 
  dplyr::select(placename, start_date, end_date) %>% 
  rename(cam = placename,
         start = start_date,
         end   = end_date)

snt_dep$area <- 68.4

# Remove the NA
snt_dep <- snt_dep[is.na(snt_dep$end)==F,]
```

After defining the detection dataframe and deployment data we need to
specify the sampling occasions. This can be done manually or with the
function build_occ(). The sampling occasions should be in a data.frame
or tibble with the following structure:

**Caution this can take a while to run**

```{r, class.source="Rmain", eval=F}
summer_dates <- as.POSIXct(c("2018-04-07 00:00:00", "2018-09-30 23:59:59"), tz = "GMT")
summer_occ <- build_occ(samp_freq = 30, # seconds between the start of each sampling occasion
                 samp_length = 2, # duration of each sampling occasion (seconds)
                 study_start = summer_dates[1],
                 study_end = summer_dates[2])

# Then build our dataframe
ste_summer <- ste_build_eh(moose_dat, snt_dep, summer_occ)

winter_dates <- as.POSIXct(c("2018-10-01 00:00:00", "2019-03-31 23:59:59"), tz = "GMT")
winter_occ <- build_occ(samp_freq = 30, # seconds between the start of each sampling occasion
                 samp_length = 2, # duration of each sampling occasion (seconds)
                 study_start = winter_dates[1],
                 study_end = winter_dates[2])

# Then build our dataframe

ste_winter <- ste_build_eh(moose_dat, snt_dep, winter_occ)

# Run the models
moose_summer_res <- ste_estN_fn(ste_summer, study_area = 1e6) # specify 1 sq kilometer
moose_wnter_res  <- ste_estN_fn(ste_winter, study_area = 1e6) # specify 1 sq kilometer
```

The results are:

Winter - 0.036 individuals per km^2^ 
Summer - 0.025 individuals per km^2^

Which are very similar to the remBoot results.

### Unmarked spatial capture recapture (uSCR)

Here you have to currently have to go beyond R - but there are some good
options and exciting new developments. See [Gilbert et al.
2021](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/cobi.13517)
for more details.

## Future directions

Direct comparisons of the different methods are starting to appear:

[Santini, Giacomo, et al. "Population assessment without individual
identification using camera-traps: A comparison of four methods." Basic
and Applied Ecology 61 (2022):
68-81.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179122000263)

"Further, while unmarked methods require less information and model
parameters, there is far greater risk of bias in estimates resulting
from model assumptions that are difficult to validate. The
inconsistencies in precision of unmarked empirical estimates, even
within the same study designs, sites, and species (Table 3), likely
demonstrate unaccounted assumption violations pertaining to animal
movement and we would expect these issues to extend to most Asian bear
populations."

The future of determining viewshed area:

[Moeller, Anna K., et al. "Best practices to account for capture
probability and viewable area in camera‚Äêbased abundance estimation."
Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation
(2022).](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rse2.300)

Nice way of estimating "day range" from camera traps which is equivalent
to telemetry data [Palencia, Pablo, et al. "Estimating day range from
camera‚Äêtrap data: the animals' behaviour as a key parameter." Journal of
Zoology 309.3 (2019):
182-190.](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jzo.12710)

And Pablo Palencia has a nice package to help you integrate speed data
derived from cameras with activity data derived from camera traps in the
activity package. See the Activity chapter!
